warning.anti.symmetry=Anti-symmetry violated: {0}\
  \n   Constraint: sgn(compare(x, y)) == -sgn(compare(y, x))\
  \n   See https://tomregan.github.io/comparatorverifier/docs/warnings/#anti_symmetry for further details.
warning.consistency=Consistency violated: {0}\
  \n   Constraint: compare(x, y) == 0 implies that signum(compare(x, z)) == signum(compare(y, z)) for all z\
  \n   See https://tomregan.github.io/comparatorverifier/docs/warnings/#consistency for further details.
warning.consistent.with.equals=Consistency with equals violated: {0}\
  \n   Constraint: (compare(x, y) == 0) == (x.equals(y) == true)\
  \n   See https://tomregan.github.io/comparatorverifier/docs/warnings/#consistent_with_equals for further details.
warning.reflexivity=Reflexivity violated: {0}\
  \n   Constraint: compare(x, x) = 0\
  \n   See https://tomregan.github.io/comparatorverifier/docs/warnings/#reflexivity for further details.
warning.serializable=Comparator does not implement Serializable {0}\
  \n   Constraint: Comparator must implement Serializable\
  \n   See https://tomregan.github.io/comparatorverifier/docs/warnings/#serializable for further details.
warning.transitivity=Transitivity violated: {0}\
  \n   Constraint: (compare(x, y) > 0) && (compare(y, z) > 0) implies that compare(x, z) > 0\
  \n   See https://tomregan.github.io/comparatorverifier/docs/warnings/#transitivity for further details.
